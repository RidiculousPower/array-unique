Initial release - split from compositing-unique-array.
Fixed require path for hooked_array to gem.
 
## 6/15/2012 ##

Fixed UniqueArray::Interface to include Array::Unique::Interface.

## 6/30/2012 ##

Renamed from unique-array to array-unique. File schema updated to reflect gem name.

Updated for fake Array inheritance support since inheriting from Array prevents #to_a from being called at splat.
